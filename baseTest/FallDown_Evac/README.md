# A test case of Falling Down Model in FDS+Evac
This test case is based on Timo's example in FDS+Evac website.  Thank Timo Korhonen for his kindly help and guidance.  
However, Faster-Is-Slower effect is observed when falling down model is used.  

The falling-down model is included in FDS6, not in FDS5, and it was initially developed by a student and included in Timo's codework.
