This example is originally based on Dr. Xiaoshan Pan's article in massEgress Project.

In the original work by Dr. Xiaoshan Pan, there is no fire and smoke simulation.  
We use FDS+EVAC to releaize a new version of simulation with fire and smoke.

There are several derivatives of examples based on the original compartment settings, and we have tested group behavior, pre-evacuation movement as well as escape from hazardous conditions by using this example.  Thus there are several .fds input files in this folder, and we will keep update these example files.  If you find any problems in running these examples, please feel free to contact me by email or use issue trackers here to report your problems.  

In general you can use fds6_dump205.exe to run these examples.  fds6_dump205.exe enables users to have multiple evacuation simulation based on the same fire data and all of fire data and evac data can be visualized together in smokeview.  Maybe I should write a better readme.txt or a small user guide here.
