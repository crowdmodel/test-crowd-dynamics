The file evac.f90 is compiled with FDS+Evac 6.5.3.  Here I attach the file to track the code changes.  
The entire program is in FDS repository.  
You may download an execuable file here, or go to FDS repository and use evac.f90 data.f90 and type.f90 together here to compile an execuable.  If you need all the source files, please feel free to send me an email or use issue tracker to submit a request.  

The latest two versions of execuable are fds6_tmpg.exe and fds6_dump205.exe
In particular fds6_dump205.exe enables users to visualize both evac data and fire data in smokeview when multiple evac simulations are run with the same fire scenario.
